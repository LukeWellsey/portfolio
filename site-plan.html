      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        I am a student at Brigham Young University - Idaho, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. I was born and raised in Southeast Idaho, an area rich with mountains and outdoor recreational opportunities, so its no surprise that in my free time, I enjoy stepping away from technology to explore the great outdoors. I've recently discovered an interest in photography, which aligns wonderfully with my time spent in nature. All the pictures on this website are my own work.

      <h3>Skills & Credentials</h3>
      <p>
        I've found a love of learning in my life beyond college, pursuing certifications and courses outside school. These credentials not only validate my knowledge and expertise in various relevant areas but also demonstrate my commitment to staying current with industry trends and best practices. I've enjoyed my time learning about these topics and hope to continue to add more to this list over time.

      </ul>
      <h3>Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        Accessible here is a collection of my applied interests, showcasing my exploration into different topics to find my niche. Here you'll find links to my Github repositories and a comprehensive view of my resume. Whether you're looking to understand my professional background, or see the practical application of my skills, this collection provides a thorough insight.

        Stair image will go at the top, with the forest image forming the background. Certification icons will go in the card images. Cards will be slightly transparent aside from the certifications logos if that looks good, to allow the image to show.

        Teton picture at the top with forest on the left lower, the projects section is a carousel and each card will redirect to that github repo in a new tab. I'd like to add a preview for the resume if possible
