# Personal Portfolio Site
Welcome to my personal portfolio site, this site can be viewed [here](https://lukewellsey.github.io/portfolio/)

## Future Changes
- would like to finish building functionality for a carousel in the portfolio page
- A button in the nav, right aligned, that allows for easy access to my resume anywhere on the site would be nice
- portfolio grid, as well as other page grids should potentially have a media query handling mobile layout or other viewport differences.
