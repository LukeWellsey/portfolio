        <h1>Hi, I'm Luke Wells</h1>
        <p>
            I am a student at Brigham Young University - Idaho, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software 
            Engineering. I was born and raised in Southeast Idaho, an area rich with mountains and outdoor recreational 
            opportunities, so its no surprise that in my free time, I enjoy stepping away from technology to explore 
            the great outdoors. I've recently discovered an interest in photography, which aligns wonderfully with my 
            time spent in nature. All the pictures on this website are my own work.
